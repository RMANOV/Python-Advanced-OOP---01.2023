# Climb the Peaks
# Alex is a vlogger and he wants to make videos of climbing the five highest peaks in Pirin mountain in just one week.  He will take his video set, a tent, and his backpack to the mountain. The backpack fits food portions for one week, exactly. His daily stamina is also limited. Your task is to trace his adventure and create a post for his profile @alaroundtheworld, at the end of the journey.
# You will have to keep information for all the conquered peaks if any.
# Every day, Alex will use one portion of his daily food supplies and will exhaust one of his daily stamina.
# First, you will be given a sequence of numbers, representing the quantities of the daily portions of food supplies in his backpack.
# Afterward, you will be given another sequence of numbers, representing the quantities of the daily stamina he will have at his disposal for the next seven days.
# You have to sum the quantity of the last daily food portion with the quantity of the first daily stamina.
# He will start climbing from the first peak in the table below to the last one.
# •	If the sum is equal to or greater than the corresponding Mountain Peak’s Difficulty level from the table below,
# it means that the peak is conquered. In this case, you should remove both quantities from the sequences and continue with the next ones towards the next peak.
# •	If the sum is less than the corresponding Mountain Peak’s Difficulty level from the table below, the peak remains unconquered.
# You should remove both quantities from the sequences. Alex will have to sleep in his tent. On the next day, he will try the same peak once again.

# Mountain Peaks	Difficulty level
# Vihren	80
# Kutelo	90
# Banski Suhodol	100
# Polezhan	60
# Kamenitza	70

# Alex will try to conquer as many peaks as he can in seven days. If he manages to climb all the peaks, 
# the journey ends and the output is printed on the Console.
# Finally, print on the Console all the conquered peaks(in the order of climbing).
# Input
# •	On the first line, you will receive the food portions, separated by a comma and a single space (', ').
# •	On the second line, you will receive the stamina, separated by a comma and a single space (', ').
# Output
# •	On the first line – print whether Alex managed to reach his goal and climb all the peaks in his list:
# o	If he managed to conquer all: "Alex did it! He climbed all top five Pirin peaks in one week -> @FIVEinAWEEK"
# o	If he didn't manage to climb all of the peaks: "Alex failed! He has to organize his journey better next time -> @PIRINWINS"
# •	Then, in either case, you need to print all the conquered peaks (in the order of climbing) if any:
# "Conquered peaks:
# {peak1}
# {peak2}
# …
# {peakn}"
# o	If there are no concurred peaks, do NOT print this message.
