# The Section class should receive a name (string) upon initialization. The task also has one instance attribute: tasks (empty list)
# The Section class should also have four methods:
# -	add_task(new_task: Task)
# o	Adds a new task to the collection and returns "Task {task details} is added to the section"
# o	If the task is already in the collection, returns "Task is already in the section {section_name}"
# -	complete_task(task_name: str)
# o	Changes the task to completed (True) and returns "Completed task {task_name}"
# o	If the task is not found, returns "Could not find task with the name {task_name}"
# -	clean_section()
# o	Removes all the completed tasks and returns "Cleared {amount of removed tasks} tasks."
# -	view_section()
# o	Returns information about the section and its tasks in this format:
#     "Section {section_name}:
#      {details of the first task}
#      {details of the second task}
#      â€¦
#      {details of the n task}"
