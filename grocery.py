# Grocery
# Create a function called grocery_store() that receives a different number of key-value pairs. 
# The key will be the product's name and the value - its quantity. 
# You should return a sorted receipt for all products. They should be sorted by their quantity in descending order. 
# If there are two or more products with the same quantity, sort them by their name's length in descending order. 
# If there are two or more products with the same name's length, sort them by their name in ascending order (alphabetically). 
# In the end, return a string in the following format:
# "{product_name1}: {product_quantity1}
# {product_name2}: {product_quantity2}
# â€¦
# {product_nameN}: {product_quantityN}"
