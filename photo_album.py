# Photo Album
# Create a class called PhotoAlbum. Upon initialization, it should receive pages (int). It should also have one more attribute: photos (empty matrix) representing the album with its pages where you should put the photos. Each page can contain only 4 photos. The class should also have 3 more methods:
# •	from_photos_count(photos_count: int) - creates a new instance of PhotoAlbum. Note: Each page can contain 4 photos.
# •	add_photo(label:str) - adds the photo in the first possible page and slot and return "{label} photo added successfully on page {page_number(starting from 1)} slot {slot_number(starting from 1)}". If there are no free slots left, return "No more free slots"
# •	display() - returns a string representation of each page and the photos in it. Each photo is marked with "[]", and the page separation is made using 11 dashes (-). For example, if we have 1 page and 2 photos:
# -----------
# [] []
# -----------
# and if we have 2 empty pages:
# -----------

# -----------

# -----------
