# Shopping Cart
# Peter has decided to invite some guests. He should go shopping, but he will need help because
# there are too many things he needs to remember. Would you assist him?
# Write a function called shopping_cart that adds products to a shopping cart for the following three types of meals:
# "Soup", "Pizza", and "Dessert". Every meal has a limit of products that can be added to it:
# •	Soup: 3
# •	Pizza: 4
# •	Dessert: 2
# Once you reach the limit of a meal, you should stop adding products to that meal.
# The function will receive a different number of arguments.
# The arguments will be passed as tuples with two elements - the first one is the type of meal,
# and the second is the product for the meal.
# You need to take each argument and make a dictionary with the meal's name as a key and the products as a value of the corresponding key.
# There are some additional requirements:
# •	If you receive the same product for the same meal more than once, you must not add it again.
# •	If you run into the word "Stop" (not tuple) as an argument, you must immediately stop adding products to the cart -
# just sort and return the desired result as described below.
# In the end, sort the meals by the number of bought products in descending order.
# If there are meals with an equal number of products, sort them (the meals) by their name in ascending order (alphabetically).
# For each meal sort its products in ascending order (alphabetically).
# Return an output as described below.
# Note: Submit only the function in the judge system
# Input
# •	There will be no input, just parameters passed to your function
# Output
# •	Return a string for each of the 3 types of a meal of the sorted result in the format:
# o	"{meal_type}:"
# " - {first_product_added}"
# " - {second_product_added}"
#  …
# " - {Nth_product_added}"
# o	If there are no products given for a meal, return just its name in the format shown above.
# •	If there are NO products in the cart (at all), return the message: "No products in the cart!"
# Constrains
# •	Each tuple given will always contain the type of meal in the first position and a product in the second.
# •	There will be no other meals passed than "Soup", "Pizza", and "Dessert".
