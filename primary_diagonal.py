# Primary Diagonal
# Write a program that finds the sum of all numbers in a matrix's primary diagonal (runs from top left to bottom right). 
# On the first line, you will receive an integer N â€“ the size of a square matrix. 
# The next N lines holds the values for each column - N numbers, separated by a single space.
