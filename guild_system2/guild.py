# The Guild class receives a name (string). 
# The Guild should also have one instance attribute players (an empty list which will contain the players of the guild). 
# The class also has 3 additional methods:
# -	assign_player(player: Player)
# o	Adds the player to the guild and returns "Welcome player {player_name} to the guild {guild_name}". 
# Remember to change the player's guild in the player class.
# o	If he is already in the guild, returns "Player {player_name} is already in the guild."
# o	If the player is in another guild, returns "Player {player_name} is in another guild."
# -	kick_player(player_name: str)
# o	Removes the player from the guild and returns "Player {player_name} has been removed from the guild.". 
# Remember to change the player's guild in the player class to "Unaffiliated".
# o	If there is no such player in the guild, returns "Player {player_name} is not in the guild."
# -	guild_info()
# o	Returns the guild's information, including the players in the guild, in the format:
# "Guild: {guild_name}
# {first_player's info}
# â€¦
# {Nplayer's info}"
