# 4.	Wild Farm
# Create the following project structure:
# •	 # animal.py
# •	 # birds.py
# •	food.py
# •	 # mammals.py
# Your task is to create a class hierarchy like the one described below. 
# The Animal, Bird, Mammal, and Food classes should be abstract:
# In the food.py file, implement the following classes:
# •	Food - the class should be abstract and should receive quantity (int) upon initialization
# •	Vegetable, Fruit, Meat and Seed classes should inherit from the Food class
# In the animal.py file, implement the following classes:
# •	Animal - the class should be abstract and should have the following attributes:
# o	name (string) - passed upon initialization
# o	weight (float) - passed upon initialization
# o	food_eaten - 0 by default 
# •	Bird - should inherit from the Animal class. 
# The class should be abstract and should have wing_size (float) as an additional attribute passed upon initialization.
# •	Mammal - should inherit from the Animal class. 
# The class should be abstract and should have living_region (str) as an additional attribute passed upon initialization.
# In the birds.py file, implement the following classes:
# •	Owl
# •	Hen
# In the mammals.py file, implement the following classes:
# •	Mouse
# •	Dog
# •	Cat
# •	Tiger
# All animals also can ask for food by producing a sound. Create a make_sound() method that returns the sound:
# •	Owl - "Hoot Hoot"
# •	Hen - "Cluck"
# •	Mouse - "Squeak"
# •	Dog - "Woof!"
# •	Cat - "Meow"
# •	Tiger - "ROAR!!!"
# Now use the classes that you have created to instantiate some animals and feed them. 
# Add method feed(food) where the food will be an instance of some food classes.
# Animals will only eat a specific type of food, as follows:
# •	Hens eat everything
# •	Mice eat vegetables and fruits
# •	Cats eat vegetables and meat
# •	Tigers, Dogs, and Owls eat only meat
# If you try to give an animal a different type of food, it will not eat it, and you should return:
# •	"{AnimalType} does not eat {FoodType}!"
# The weight of an animal will increase with every piece of food it eats, as follows:
# •	Hen - 0.35
# •	Owl - 0.25
# •	Mouse - 0.10
# •	Cat - 0.30
# •	Dog - 0.40
# •	Tiger - 1.00
# Override the __repr__() method to print the information about an animal in the formats:
# •	Birds - "{AnimalType} [{AnimalName}, {WingSize}, {AnimalWeight}, {FoodEaten}]"
# •	Mammals - "{AnimalType} [{AnimalName}, {AnimalWeight}, {AnimalLivingRegion}, {FoodEaten}]"
